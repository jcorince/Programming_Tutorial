		//e.g. 2a3b5c -> aabbbccccc
		//Hint: first start with inputs where there is always a number and then a character, 
		//then think about how
		//to improve your code such that you can use values greater or equal 10, eg. 10a13b22c
		//Further modification: if a character should only be printed one time you don't need 
		//to write any number infront of that character
		//e.g. a3b12cd5e -> abbbccccccccccccdeeeee
